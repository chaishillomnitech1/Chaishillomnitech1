# ScrollVerse Governance Automation

## Experimental Protocols

1. **Voting Mechanism**: Introduction of a decentralized voting mechanism allowing creators to propose and vote on governance changes.

2. **Proposal Lifecycles**: Define the stages of proposals, from submission to implementation, with clear timelines.

3. **Feedback Loop**: An integrated feedback system for community suggestions and iterations.

## Decision Automation Scripts

Automate decision-making by implementing scripts that handle:
- Proposal evaluation based on creator votes.
- Automatic execution of governance changes based on threshold approvals.

## Creator Incentive Frameworks

### Rewards Logic
- **Participation Rewards**: Incentives for creators who actively participate in governance.
- **Performance Bonuses**: Additional rewards based on the quality of contributions and impact on the community.

### Implementation Plan
- Phase 1: Design the governance structure and stakeholder incentives.
- Phase 2: Develop and test smart contracts for automation.
- Phase 3: Launch pilot program and iterate based on feedback.
