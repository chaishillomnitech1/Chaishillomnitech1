## 🔗 Integration with Existing Systems

### Frequency Configuration

All systems integrate with `/frequency_config.json`:
- Primary frequencies (528Hz, 963Hz)
- Secondary frequencies (999Hz, 144000Hz)
- Sacred geometry ratios
- Protection levels

### Metrics System

Builds on existing `/scripts/genesis_drop_metrics_config.js`:
- Compatible metric structure
- Shared data formats
- Consistent reporting

### Strategic Alignment

Connects to broader vision:
- Phase 4+ resonance protocols
- Infinite growth frameworks
- Divine consciousness integration

## 💡 Best Practices

### Data Updates
- Update metrics daily for accuracy
- Use consistent time zones
- Validate data before running reports
- Keep historical data for trends

### Monitoring
- Check alerts every morning
- Review recommendations weekly
- Track milestone progress
- Celebrate wins

### Optimization
- Implement top priority recommendations first
- A/B test major changes
- Measure impact of interventions
- Iterate based on data

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Package.json Issue

There is a pre-existing JSON syntax error in `package.json` that prevents npm scripts from running. This does NOT affect the self-sustaining systems.

**Workaround**: Run scripts directly with Node.js:
```bash
node systems/self-sustaining/[script-name].js
```

See `PACKAGE_JSON_FIX_NEEDED.md` for details and fix instructions.

### Data Storage

All metrics are stored locally in JSON files:
- `metrics/frequency_outputs.json`
- `metrics/auto_feedback_963hz.json`
- `metrics/growth_goals.json`

**Backup**: These files should be backed up regularly.

---

## 🔧 Customization

### Adjust Frequency Multipliers

Edit `frequency-to-output-converter.js`:
```javascript
const frequencyMultipliers = {
  528: 1.2,   // Your custom value
  963: 1.4,
  999: 1.618,
  144000: 2.0
};
```

### Modify Growth Goals

Edit `growth-goals-tracker.js`:
```javascript
this.goals = {
  users: { target: 100 },  // Your target
  revenue: { target: 1000 }
};
```

### Customize Dashboard

Edit `growth-dashboard.html` CSS/JavaScript to match your branding.

## 🆘 Support

### Self-Service
1. Check `QUICK_START.md` for common tasks
2. Review `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for technical details
3. Read `PACKAGE_JSON_FIX_NEEDED.md` for known issues

### Troubleshooting
- **Scripts won't run**: Use Node.js directly (see note above)
- **Metrics not saving**: Check file permissions in `metrics/` directory
- **Dashboard not loading**: Open directly in browser, ensure JavaScript enabled
