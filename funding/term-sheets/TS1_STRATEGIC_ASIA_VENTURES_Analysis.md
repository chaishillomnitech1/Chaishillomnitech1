4. **China Exposure Complexity** ⚠️
   - Shanghai office = mainland China operations

## RECOMMENDATION

### Decision

**✅ STRONGLY RECOMMEND ACCEPTING** (with minor negotiation points)

### Rationale (Top 3 Reasons)

1. **Best-in-Class Asia Capabilities**: SAV's 5-office network, proven expansion track record, and David Chen's personal expertise make them uniquely positioned to enable our 10x Asia multiplier strategy. No other investor can match this.

2. **Founder-Friendly Terms at Premium Valuation**: $520M valuation (4% above target) with clean economic terms (1x non-participating, weighted avg anti-dilution, minimal protective provisions) is exceptional for Series A. We get capital AND sovereignty.

3. **Strategic Alignment + Financial Strength**: Portfolio synergies (MetaMusic, TechDAO, SpiritFlow), Series B capacity ($150M reserve), and reference checks (9/10) indicate this is a true partner, not just a check-writer.

### Key Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| Portfolio conflicts | Medium | Add right of first refusal clause for partnerships |
| China vs. Japan prioritization | Low | Bind Asia roadmap as exhibit to term sheet |
| Investor bandwidth | Low | Secure quarterly in-person commitment from David Chen |
| Entertainment sector inexperience | Low | Leverage their network to introduce specialists |

### Negotiation Strategy

**Approach**: "We're excited about SAV and view them as our top choice. We have a few clarifying points to ensure alignment, but we're prepared to move quickly."

**Sequence**:
1. Lead with Asia strategy appendix (shows we're serious about expansion)
2. Request portfolio conflict provision (framed as "mutual success")
3. Ask for board engagement commitment (shows we value David's time)
4. Optional: Probe on Series B language (if they're amenable)

**Timeline**: 
- Week 1: Negotiate modifications, get revised term sheet
- Week 2: Sign term sheet, commence legal diligence
- Week 3-6: Close funding round

**Confidence Level**: **95%** - Terms are strong, firm is motivated, risks are manageable
