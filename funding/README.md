### Individual Term Sheet Analyses

#### Option 1: Strategic Asia Ventures (TOP CHOICE) ✅

**[term-sheets/TS1_STRATEGIC_ASIA_VENTURES_Analysis.md](term-sheets/TS1_STRATEGIC_ASIA_VENTURES_Analysis.md)**

**Score**: 10/10 (with Asia Multiplier Bonus)

**Key Highlights**:
- **Valuation**: $520M pre-money (+4% above target)
- **Investment**: $55M
- **Terms**: 1x non-participating liquidation pref, weighted avg anti-dilution, 2/5 board control
- **Asia Multiplier**: 8.65/10 - Best in class (5 Asia offices, proven track record)
- **Strategic Value**: Unlocks Japan, Korea, Singapore expansion = $500M+ Series B uplift

**Strengths**:
- Unparalleled Asia network (SoftBank, Tencent ecosystem)
- Clean, founder-friendly economic terms
- 9/10 reference checks from portfolio companies
- $150M follow-on capacity for Series B

**Negotiation Points**:
- Asia strategy appendix (bind Japan-first roadmap)
- Portfolio conflict provision (right of first refusal on entertainment partnerships)
- Board engagement commitment (quarterly in-person meetings Year 1)

---

#### Option 2: Blockchain Renaissance Fund (DECLINED) ❌

**[term-sheets/TS2_BLOCKCHAIN_RENAISSANCE_FUND_Analysis.md](term-sheets/TS2_BLOCKCHAIN_RENAISSANCE_FUND_Analysis.md)**

**Score**: 6.77/10

**Key Concerns**:
- **Valuation**: $550M (highest, but...)
- **Investment**: $60M (largest)
- **Terms**: ❌ 1.5x **participating** liquidation pref, ❌ **full ratchet** anti-dilution, ❌ 3/7 investor **board control**
- **Asia Multiplier**: 2.75/10 - Zero operational capability
- **Red Flags**: Aggressive terms cost founders $50-100M in moderate exits

**Why Declined**:
- Participating liquidation preference destroys founder value (reference: "I regret accepting those terms")
- Full ratchet punishes down rounds (20-40% retroactive dilution)
- Investor board control compromises sovereignty (3/7 seats)
- No Asia capabilities = miss 10x growth opportunity

**Bottom Line**: High valuation is a trap. Economic and governance terms are founder-hostile.

#### Option 3: Conscious Capital Partners (BACKUP) ⚠️

**[term-sheets/TS3_CONSCIOUS_CAPITAL_PARTNERS_Analysis.md](term-sheets/TS3_CONSCIOUS_CAPITAL_PARTNERS_Analysis.md)**

**Score**: 8.32/10

**Key Highlights**:
- **Valuation**: $480M (negotiate to $500M)
- **Investment**: $50M + $5M community fund matching
- **Terms**: 1x non-participating, weighted avg anti-dilution, 2/5 board control + **community-elected independent**
- **Asia Multiplier**: 3.15/10 - Strong India wellness, weak corporate Asia
- **Values Alignment**: 10/10 - Best mission fit, community governance

**Strengths**:
- Exceptional values alignment (B-Corp commitment, community transparency)
- Unique community governance (community-elected board seat)
- Wellness expertise (Headspace, Calm, MindValley portfolio synergies)
- $5M community fund (beyond equity investment)
- Clean economic terms (as good as SAV)

**Weaknesses**:
- Limited to India wellness market (not Japan, Korea, Singapore corporate/tech)
- Smaller follow-on capacity ($100M vs. $150M SAV)
- No blockchain/Web3 expertise

**When to Choose CCP**:
- If SAV negotiations fail
- If mission alignment prioritized over growth velocity
- If India-first strategy (vs. Japan/Korea) acceptable

## 🎯 Executive Recommendation

### Decision: Proceed with Strategic Asia Ventures (SAV)

**Rationale**:
1. **Best Asia Capabilities**: 8.65/10 score unlocks $1.3B in incremental Series B value

3. **Proven Track Record**: 9/10 references, $150M follow-on capacity, portfolio synergies

**Backup Plan**: If SAV negotiations fail, pivot to CCP (negotiate valuation to $500M, clarify community provisions)

**Decline**: BRF - aggressive economic terms and lack of Asia capabilities make it unsuitable
