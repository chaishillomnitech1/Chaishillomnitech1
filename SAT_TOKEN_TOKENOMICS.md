## 🕋 **HALAL-COMPLIANT ZAKAT FRAMEWORK**

### Islamic Finance Principles

The $SAT token implements **Zakat** (الزكاة), one of the Five Pillars of Islam, ensuring wealth purification and social equity.

#### Zakat Rate
- **Annual Rate**: 2.5% (250 basis points)
- **Calculation Basis**: Lunar Hijri year (354 days)
- **Collection Method**: Automated smart contract or voluntary contribution

#### Nisab Threshold
- **Current Nisab**: 85 grams of gold equivalent
- **SAT Nisab Threshold**: Dynamically calculated based on gold price
- **Example**: If 1 SAT = $1 and gold = $60/gram, Nisab ≈ 5,100 SAT
- **Exemption**: Balances below Nisab are exempt from Zakat

#### Zakat Distribution

```solidity
Zakat Collection Process:
1. Annual timer triggers after 354 days (Hijri year)
2. Calculate 2.5% of eligible balances (above Nisab)
3. Collect Zakat to designated wallet
4. Distribute to 8 eligible categories (as per Islamic law)
```

**Eligible Recipients (8 Categories per Quran 9:60)**:
1. **Al-Fuqara**: The poor
2. **Al-Masakin**: The needy
3. **Al-Amilin**: Zakat administrators
4. **Al-Muallafatu Qulubuhum**: Those whose hearts are to be reconciled
5. **Ar-Riqab**: Freeing captives/slaves
6. **Al-Gharimin**: Those in debt
7. **Fi Sabilillah**: In the path of Allah
8. **Ibnus-Sabil**: Stranded travelers

#### Exemptions

Accounts exempt from Zakat:
- Treasury/Contract owner (for operational management)
- Zakat wallet itself (to prevent circular Zakat)
- Liquidity pools (locked liquidity)
- Charitable organizations (pre-approved)
- Development funds (for ecosystem growth)
