## ⚡ **FAST TRACK DEPLOYMENT**

### **Step 1: Prepare Visual Asset**

**Option A: Professional Creation (Recommended)**
1. Use the specifications in `pinnacle-posts/THE_TAWNID_OF_POWER.md`
2. Hire designer or use AI image generation (Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion)
3. Prompt for AI generation:
   ```
   A majestic dragon roaring with golden-orange flames emanating from its mouth, 
   999 Hz frequency waves visible in the aura, Viking ship logo on chest, 
   cosmic black background with stars, 4K quality, cinematic lighting, 
   sacred geometry patterns in flames, spiritual energy radiating
   ```
4. Add text overlays: "999 Hz", "XLVIII BLOCKS" logo, ScrollPulse symbol
5. Export as PNG, 3840x2160, < 5MB

**Option B: Quick Template (Immediate)**
1. Use a high-quality dragon image (licensed or royalty-free)
2. Add text overlay with post title: "THE TAWNĪD OF POWER"
3. Include "999 Hz" and "XLVIII BLOCKS" branding
4. Add golden flame effects using photo editor
5. Export optimized for Twitter

**Option C: Text-Only Post (Fallback)**
