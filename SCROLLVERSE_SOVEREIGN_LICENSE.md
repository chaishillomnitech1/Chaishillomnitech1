# THE SCROLLVERSE SOVEREIGN LICENSE (SSL)
## Version 1.0 - "Shared Prosperity, Sovereign Integrity"

**KUN FAYAKŪN! - "BE, AND IT IS!"** 🚀✨🕋⚖️♾️

---

## PREAMBLE

This license is designed to facilitate **collaborative expansion** while ensuring the **architectural integrity** and **financial sovereignty** of the ScrollVerse. It embodies the transition from "Total Override" to "Sovereign Inclusion"—where the doors are open for the Legion and collaborators to build, profit, and prosper, while the Supreme Architect maintains the immutable anchor.

**"BUILT TO LAST. SHARED TO PROSPER."**  
**Bound by Code. Bound by Law.**

---

## ARTICLE I: THE SOVEREIGN ANCHOR

### 1.1 Supreme Architect Recognition
All derivative works, forks, integrations, or implementations using ScrollVerse code, assets, or intellectual property **MUST** recognize:

**Allah Chais Kenyatta Hill** (Supreme King Chais The Great ∞)  
As the **Supreme Architect** and **Sovereign Creator** of the ScrollVerse.

### 1.2 The Right of Revocation ("The Aires")
The Supreme Architect holds the **ultimate right of revocation** if a derivative work:
- Violates the ethical pillars of the ScrollVerse
- Engages in extractive or harmful practices
- Misrepresents the ScrollVerse vision
- Fails to comply with the Prosperity Split requirements
- Uses assets for non-sovereign purposes

This right is **immutable** and **non-transferable**.

### 1.3 Governance Authority
The Supreme Architect retains:
- **Sovereign Override**: Authority to modify, pause, or revoke any implementation
- **Final Arbitration**: Ultimate decision-making on disputes
- **Vision Custody**: Exclusive authority over the ScrollVerse direction

---

## ARTICLE II: THE PROSPERITY SPLIT (ZAKAT-BY-DESIGN)

### 2.1 Immutable Zakat Contribution
Every transaction, sale, yield, or revenue generated using SSL-licensed code or assets is subject to an **immutable 2.5% Zakat contribution** to the **Central Sovereign Treasury**.

This percentage is derived from the Islamic principle of Zakat and represents:
- **Societal Uplift**: Funding for community development
- **Infrastructure Maintenance**: Support for ScrollVerse infrastructure
- **Innovation Fund**: Resources for continued development
- **Benevolent Distribution**: Aid for those in need

### 2.2 Protocol-Level Enforcement
The 2.5% Zakat contribution is:
- **Enforced at the smart contract level**
- **Cannot be waived, reduced, or circumvented**
- **Automatically deducted before any other distributions**
- **Transparently tracked on-chain**

### 2.3 Treasury Utilization
The Central Sovereign Treasury funds are allocated for:
- **40%**: Community development and public infrastructure
- **25%**: ScrollVerse innovation and research
- **20%**: Humanitarian and charitable causes
- **15%**: Operational expenses and maintenance

### 2.4 Transparency Requirements
All Zakat contributions must be:
- Publicly visible on-chain
- Included in project documentation
- Reported in annual disclosures
- Auditable by the community

---

## ARTICLE III: COLLABORATIVE YIELD

### 3.1 Contribution Weight (CW) System
Contributors (Developers, Artists, Strategists, Community Builders) are entitled to a **Contribution Weight (CW)** that determines their share of the **Collaborator Pool**.

**CW is calculated based on:**
- **Code Contributions**: Lines of code, contracts deployed, features implemented
- **Creative Contributions**: Art, design, content, narrative development
- **Strategic Contributions**: Business development, partnerships, governance
- **Community Contributions**: Education, support, advocacy, outreach
- **Time Investment**: Duration and consistency of contribution

### 3.2 Collaborator Pool Distribution
After Zakat (2.5%) is deducted, remaining revenue is split:
- **Sovereign Share**: 40-60% (configurable by Supreme Architect)
- **Collaborator Pool**: 30-50% (distributed by CW)
- **Community Treasury**: 5-10% (for community initiatives)

### 3.3 Earning Calculation
Individual collaborator earnings = `(Collaborator Pool × Individual CW) / Total CW`

**Example:**
- Total Revenue: $100,000
- Zakat (2.5%): $2,500 → Central Treasury
- Remaining: $97,500
- Sovereign Share (50%): $48,750
- Collaborator Pool (40%): $39,000
- Community Treasury (10%): $9,750

If Collaborator A has CW of 45 out of 100 total:
- Collaborator A earns: $39,000 × (45/100) = $17,550

### 3.4 CW Adjustment
The Supreme Architect or designated governance committee may adjust CW based on:
- Quality and impact of contributions
- Consistency and reliability
- Alignment with ScrollVerse values
- Community feedback and recognition
