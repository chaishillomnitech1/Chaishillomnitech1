## 🎨 Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript/JSX

```javascript
// Use modern ES6+ syntax
const calculateIncome = (balance, rate) => {
  return balance * rate;
};

// Clear variable names
const passiveIncome = calculateIncome(balance, dailyRate);

// Comments for complex logic
// Calculate daily passive income based on 0.005% rate
const dailyRate = 0.00005;
```

### Solidity

```solidity
// Follow OpenZeppelin standards
// Use explicit visibility modifiers
// Add NatSpec comments

/**
 * @notice Claims accumulated passive income for the caller
 * @dev Updates lastClaimTime and mints new tokens
 * @return amount The amount of income claimed
 */
function claimPassiveIncome() external returns (uint256 amount) {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Python

```python
# Follow PEP 8 style guide
# Use type hints
# Add docstrings

def calculate_passive_income(balance: float, rate: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate passive income based on balance and rate.
    
    Args:
        balance: Current token balance
        rate: Daily interest rate
        
    Returns:
        Calculated passive income amount
    """
    return balance * rate
```
