**Subject**: Blockchain for Social Good: Operation Bounce Back Partnership

**Body**:

[Influencer Name],

Following your coverage of [recent crypto topic], I wanted to reach out about something that might interest you—a charitable initiative that's actually using blockchain correctly.

**The Tech:**

We've built a dual-token system (NFT + ERC-20) on Polygon that:
- Tracks charitable donations with embedded QR codes linking to impact records
- Incentivizes real-world charitable actions with token rewards
- Implements staking mechanisms with variable APY (8-18%) based on lock periods
- Includes bonus multipliers for documented charitable activity
- Uses on-chain governance for fund allocation transparency

**The Innovation:**

This isn't just "slap an NFT on it"—we've designed:
- Dynamic metadata that updates as impact grows
- Soulbound options for non-transferable recognition badges
- Charitable action verification system with community validation
- Perpetual royalty model (10%) funding ongoing operations
- Multi-sig treasury with transparent on-chain accounting

**The Mission:**

Chef Andre Murphy is feeding underserved communities. We're providing the tech infrastructure to make it transparent, scalable, and sustainable.

**The Partnership:**

Given your audience's sophistication around blockchain tech, I'd love to:
- Get your feedback on our smart contract architecture
- Have you cover the project from a technical perspective
- Collaborate on educational content about "blockchain for good"
- Potentially advise on our technical roadmap

**Compensation:**

- Standard influencer fee: [$ amount]
- Allocation of [X] DE Tokens (full disclosure: not tradable yet, but will be)

Best,
[Your Name]
Tech Lead, Operation Bounce Back

P.S. If you'd rather just cover it organically, that's cool too—we're not trying to gate real information behind partnerships.

### Template 4: Social Impact/Activist Influencer Outreach

**Subject**: Revolutionary Approach to Charitable Giving—Your Thoughts?

**Body**:

[Influencer Name],

Your work on [specific cause/campaign] has been powerful. I've been following your advocacy for [timeframe], and I genuinely respect how you [specific thing they do well].

I'm writing because I think you'll find Operation Bounce Back interesting—potentially partnership-worthy, but honestly, I'd just value your perspective.

**The Challenge We're Solving:**

Traditional charity has trust issues:
- Where does money actually go?
- How much goes to "overhead"?
- What's the real impact per dollar?

**Our Approach:**

Chef Andre Murphy + Blockchain Technology:
- Every meal is tracked on-chain (immutable record)
- Donors get NFTs with embedded QR codes showing their specific impact
- Community members earn tokens for volunteering (gamified giving)
- 100% transparency—every transaction visible

**Why This Matters:**

This isn't about making charity "trendy" with NFTs—it's about:
- Building trust through radical transparency
- Empowering communities with ownership (tokens = governance)
- Creating sustainable funding (royalties fund perpetual operations)
- Dignifying both givers and receivers (no poverty porn)

**The Partnership Idea:**

I'd love to explore how we could:
- Amplify your existing advocacy with OBB content
- Create impact stories that inspire your audience to action
- Use the platform to highlight issues you care about
- Fair compensation that respects your work

But honestly? Even if partnership isn't right, I'd love your feedback. We're trying to do this right, and your voice matters.

15-minute call to discuss? I'm flexible on timing.

In solidarity,
[Your Name]
Operation Bounce Back

## 📞 Phone/Video Call Script

### Opening (First 2 Minutes)

"Hey [Name], thanks so much for taking the time to chat! Before I dive in, I want to say I've genuinely been following your content—[specific compliment]—and that's actually why you came to mind for this.

I promise I'm not going to take more than 15-20 minutes of your time. Cool if I give you a quick 3-minute overview, and then we can see if this resonates with you?"

[Wait for agreement]

### The Pitch (3 Minutes)

**The Hook:**
"So, Operation Bounce Back is Chef Andre Murphy's initiative to feed underserved communities. But here's what makes it different—we're using blockchain technology to create complete transparency around charitable giving."

**The How:**
"Every donation gets you an NFT—not just a collectible, but a certificate with an embedded QR code that links to the actual impact of your contribution. Plus, we've created a token called DE (Divine Essence) that rewards people for volunteering and charitable actions. Think of it as gamifying giving."

**The Why:**
"The problem we're solving is trust. People want to give, but they don't trust where their money goes. With blockchain, every meal we serve is tracked on-chain. Every dollar is visible. It's radical transparency."

**The Results So Far:**
"In our pilot, we've served [X] meals, raised $[X], and we're about to launch publicly. We've got [X] corporate partners already committed and we're building a movement."

### The Ask (2 Minutes)

"So here's where you come in. We're looking for [X number] influencers who align with our values to help us amplify this message. Not just posting an ad—actually being part of the story.

Here's what we're thinking:
- [Specific content deliverables]
- [Compensation]
- [Unique opportunities/access]
- [Token/NFT allocation]

The goal isn't just views—it's real impact. Feeding families. Building sustainable change.

What are your initial thoughts? Does this resonate with you?"

### Handling Objections

**"I don't really understand crypto/NFTs..."**
"That's totally fair, and actually most people don't. That's why we need your voice—to help translate this for regular people. The tech is just a tool; the story is about feeding families. We'll handle all the technical stuff; you just tell the story authentically."

**"What's the time commitment?"**
"We're thinking [X] pieces of content over [timeframe]. We're flexible on format—whatever works best for your audience. We provide all the footage, access, and resources. You just create in your style."

**"How do I know this is legit?"**
"Great question. Everything is open-source and audited. You can see our smart contracts on GitHub, our transactions on the blockchain, and we can connect you with our existing partners like [name companies]. We're also happy to start with one piece of content to see if it feels right before committing to more."

**"I've had bad experiences with brand partnerships..."**
"I hear you. That's why we're leading with transparency and flexibility. You maintain creative control. We want authentic advocacy, not scripted ads. And if at any point it doesn't feel right, you can walk away—no hard feelings."

### Closing (2 Minutes)

"So here's what I'm thinking—does this feel like something you'd want to explore further?

If yes, next steps would be:
1. We send you a detailed partnership proposal with all terms
2. You review and share feedback
3. We hop on another call to finalize details
4. We send you media kit and early access to the platform

Sound good? Any questions I can answer right now?"

[If yes: get next meeting scheduled]
[If no: "No worries at all! Appreciate your time. Mind if I follow up in [timeframe] in case timing changes?"]
