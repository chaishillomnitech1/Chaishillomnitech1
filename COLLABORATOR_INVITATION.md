## WHAT WE OFFER

### **The Shared Prosperity Protocol (SPP)**

When you contribute to the ScrollVerse, you don't just get paid—you become a **stakeholder in an empire**.

#### **Contribution Weight (CW) System**
Your impact is measured, recognized, and rewarded:

- **🏆 Code Contributions**: Every smart contract, feature, and line of code
- **🎨 Creative Work**: Every artwork, design, and content piece
- **📈 Strategic Impact**: Business development, partnerships, growth
- **👥 Community Building**: Education, support, advocacy, and outreach
- **⏰ Time Investment**: Consistency and dedication over time

Your Contribution Weight determines your share of the **Collaborator Pool**.

#### **Revenue Distribution Model**

Every transaction in the ScrollVerse follows this immutable split:

```
Total Revenue: 100%
├─ 2.5%: Zakat (Central Sovereign Treasury) ← IMMUTABLE
└─ 97.5%: Distributed as:
   ├─ 40-60%: Sovereign Share (Supreme Architect)
   ├─ 30-50%: Collaborator Pool (YOU - based on CW)
   └─ 5-10%: Community Treasury (Public goods)
```

**Example**: On $100,000 in revenue:
- **$2,500** → Zakat Treasury (societal uplift, infrastructure)
- **$48,750** → Sovereign Architect (40-60% configurable)
- **$39,000** → Collaborator Pool (distributed by Contribution Weight)
- **$9,750** → Community Treasury (grants, education, public goods)

If you hold **45% Contribution Weight** out of 100 total:
- **Your earnings: $17,550** from that distribution

#### **Transparency & Trust**
- All revenue tracked on-chain
- Smart contracts enforce automatic distribution
- Real-time analytics dashboard
- Public audit trail of all transactions
- No intermediaries, no hidden fees
