# Recursive Language Model (RLM) Integration Stages

## Stage 1: Initialization
- Set up the necessary prerequisites and configurations for the AkashicApp integration.
- Define core parameters for the RLM.

## Stage 2: Data Preparation
- Gather and preprocess data needed for the RLM.
- Implement techniques to handle infinite recursion effectively.

## Stage 3: Model Training
- Utilize available datasets to train the RLM.
- Monitor training for accuracy and stability.

## Stage 4: Testing Environment Refinement
- Create separate environments to test different aspects of the RLM integration.
- Use automated testing tools to ensure reliability.

## Stage 5: Live Testing
- Conduct live tests to validate model functionality and integration with AkashicApp.
- Record and analyze test results to make improvements.

## Important Considerations:
- Ensure that infinite recursion capabilities are stable to prevent crashes.
- Continuously refine testing environments based on performance metrics.
